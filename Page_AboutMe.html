        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h5>NU Fairview Student <span>(BSIT-MI)</span></h5>
          <p>Hello there! I'm Jhon Travis Deligero, a 20-year-old BSIT-MI student with a passion for programming. Originally from Caloocan City, and I thrive on becoming a professional programmer someday. Outside of being a student, you'll often find me playing video games on my console. I believe in the power of "Technology is neither good nor bad; it's up to us how we wield it.", and I'm always seeking new ways to gain knowledge to improve my skill as a future programmer.</p>
